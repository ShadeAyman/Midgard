					<h1>FRIGG</h1>
					<h3>The All Father</h3>

					<p>Frigg is a fertility goddess in Norse mythology. She is the wife of Odin, king of the gods, and
						is the greatest goddess of the Norse pantheon. She is thought to have developed, along with the
						goddess Freyja, from an earlier fertility deity. Friday (Frigga’s Day) is named in her honor.

						She is thought to have originally been known in German Mythology as Frija ("beloved") who then
						became both Frigg and Freyja in Norse Mythology (though this claim has been challenged). In the
						8th-century CE work, The Origin of the Lombards by Paul the Deacon, she is known as Freia,
						Odin’s wife, who helps the Lombards win their decisive military victory and is responsible for
						their name. She is also known as Hiln (though this is sometimes her daughter or her messenger),
						Frigga, Frea, and Fria.

						Her primary attributes are clairvoyance, cleverness, and prophecy, and she was known as the
						goddess of marriage and motherhood. Frigg was the mother of Baldr, god of wisdom and beauty, and
						the blind god Hodr, who is tricked by the mischievous Loki into killing his brother. Contrary to
						the assertions of some writers, she is not the mother of Thor, Odin’s son, who is Baldr’s
						half-brother. The death of Baldr (also given as Baldur) is among the few tales featuring Frigg
						at any length since, even though she is regularly referenced as a powerful goddess who knows the
						fate of all, she does not appear in many tales except, sometimes, as a peripheral figure. She
						was a völva (seeress), however, and seems to have been popular in divination rites.

						The Norse religion was the last of the pagan belief systems to fall to Christianity, and Frigg,
						for all her power and popularity, was replaced by Christian tales along with all the other Norse
						deities. She has experienced a revival of interest in the last 50 years, however, through the
						efforts of the Wiccan and Neo-Pagan movements. Many people, especially women, devote themselves
						to Frigg as their deity of choice just as they did in ancient times.</p>

				<p>Frigg is mentioned throughout the Poetic Edda, compiled in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson.
					Frigg is first mentioned in the Prose Edda Prologue, wherein a euhemerized account of the Norse gods
					is provided. The author describes Frigg as the wife of Odin, and, in a case of folk etymology, the
					author attempts to associate the name Frigg with the Latin-influenced form Frigida.[23] The Prologue
					adds that both Frigg and Odin "had the gift of prophecy."[23]

					In the next section of the Prose Edda, Gylfaginning, High tells Gangleri (the king Gylfi in
					disguise) that Frigg, daughter of Fjörgynn (Old Norse Fjörgynsdóttir) is married to Odin and that
					the Æsir are descended from the couple, and adds that "the earth [Jörðin] was [Odin's] daughter and
					his wife."[24] According to High, the two had many sons, the first of which was the mighty god
					Thor.[24]
					Later in Gylfaginning, Gangleri asks about the ásynjur, a term for Norse goddesses. High says that
					"highest" among them is Frigg and that only Freyja "is highest in rank next to her." Frigg dwells in
					Fensalir "and it is very splendid."[25] In this section of Gylfaginning, Frigg is also mentioned in
					connection to other ásynjur: Fulla carries Frigg's ashen box, "looks after her footwear and shares
					her secrets;" Lofn is given special permission by Frigg and Odin to "arrange unions" among men and
					women; Hlín is charged by Frigg to protect those that Frigg deem worthy of keeping from danger; and
					Gná is sent by Frigg "into various worlds to carry out her business."[26]

					In section 49 of Gylfaginning, a narrative about the fate of Frigg's son Baldr is told. According to
					High, Baldr once started to have dreams indicating that his life was in danger. When Baldr told his
					fellow Æsir about his dreams, the gods met together for a thing and decided that they should
					"request immunity for Baldr from all kinds of danger." Frigg subsequently receives promises from the
					elements, the environment, diseases, animals, and stones, amongst other things. The request
					successful, the Æsir make sport of Baldr's newfound invincibility; shot or struck, Baldr remained
					unharmed. However, Loki discovers this and is not pleased by this turn of events, so, in the form of
					a woman, he goes to Frigg in Fensalir.[27]

					There, Frigg asks this female visitor what the Æsir are up to assembled at the thing. The woman says
					that all of the Æsir are shooting at Baldr and yet he remains unharmed. Frigg explains that "Weapons
					and wood will not hurt Baldr. I have received oaths from them all."[27] The woman asks Frigg if all
					things have sworn not to hurt Baldr, to which Frigg notes one exception; "there grows a shoot of a
					tree to the west of Val-hall. It is called mistletoe. It seemed young to me to demand the oath
					from."[27] Loki immediately disappears.[27]</p>
