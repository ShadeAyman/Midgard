									<h1>Odin</h1> 
									<h3>The All Father</h3>

									<p>Odin, also called Wodan, Woden, or Wotan, one of the principal gods in Norse mythology. His exact nature and role, however, are difficult to determine because of the complex picture of him given by the wealth of archaeological and literary sources. The Roman historian Tacitus stated that the Teutons worshiped Mercury; and because dies Mercurii (“Mercury's day”) was identified with Wednesday (“Woden's day”), there is little doubt that the god Woden (the earlier form of Odin) was meant. Though Woden was worshiped preeminently, there is not sufficient evidence of his cult to show whether it was practiced by all the Teutonic tribes or to enable conclusions to be drawn about the nature of the god. Later literary sources, however, indicate that at the end of the pre-Christian period Odin was the principal god in Scandinavia.</p>

								<p>From earliest times Odin was a war god, and he appeared in heroic literature as the protector of heroes; fallen warriors joined him in Valhalla. The wolf and the raven were dedicated to him. His magical horse, Sleipnir, had eight legs, teeth inscribed with runes, and the ability to gallop through the air and over the sea. Odin was the great magician among the gods and was associated with runes. He was also the god of poets. In outward appearance he was a tall, old man, with flowing beard and only one eye (the other he gave in exchange for wisdom). He was usually depicted wearing a cloak and a wide-brimmed hat and carrying a spear.</p>
								<p>The poem Hávamál (Old Norse 'Sayings of the High One') consists entirely of wisdom verse attributed to Odin. This advice ranges from the practical ("A man shouldn't hold onto the cup but drink in moderation, it's necessary to speak or be silent; no man will blame you for impoliteness if you go early to bed"), to the mythological (such as Odin's recounting of his retrieval of Óðrœrir, the vessel containing the mead of poetry), and to the mystical (the final section of the poem consists of Odin's recollection of eighteen charms).[51] Among the various scenes that Odin recounts is his self-sacrifice:</p>

								<div class="powem">
									<p>I know that I hung on a wind-rocked tree,
										nine whole nights,
										with a spear wounded, and to Odin offered,
										myself to myself;
										on that tree, of which no one knows
										from what root it springs.
										Bread no one gave me, nor a horn of drink,
										downward I peered,
										to runes applied myself, wailing learnt them,
										then fell down thence.</p>
									<p>
										I ween that I hung on the windy tree,
										Hung there for nine nights full nine;
										With the spear I was wounded, and offered I was,
										To Othin, myself to myself,
										On the tree that none may know
										What root beneath it runs.
										None made me happy with a loaf or horn,
										And there below I looked;
										I took up the runes, shrieking I took them,
										And forthwith back I fell.
									</p>
									<p>
										I know that I hung on a windy tree
										nine long nights,
										wounded with a spear, dedicated to Odin,
										myself to myself,
										on that tree of which no man knows
										from where its roots run.
										No bread did they give me nor a drink from a horn,
										downwards I peered;
										I took up the runes, screaming I took them,
										then I fell back from there.
									</p>
